# Fame By Scoring Rounds

This project will change how you mainly gain fame in the Game "Humankind" from Amplitude Studios.

There are three options for gaining fame:

#### by Ratio
You gain fame by being compared on category level to other empires. The ratio you have of the total sum of all empires is the ratio of fame you will gain. Since this compares your contribution in a certain category to the sum of all empires, the fame gain can vary wildy between empires.

Example: MoneyStock -> this and all other items will be accumulated in the category, then your contribution to the toal is calculated and you gain fame dependent on it. A single empire may take a large part of the fame pool.

#### by Rank per Category
You gain fame by being at a certain place in each category. Additional fame is rewarded to the upper half of the empires. Generally, the fame the empires gain is more closely together.

Example: MoneyStock -> like above, but instead of percentage ratio the fame you gain is strictly decided by the rank each empire has in that category from all items. Someone with a very high value may decide the ranking with a single item, but the fame fixed by rank. The fame each empire gains is limited to what the ranking place offers.

#### by Rank per Property
Every single item (like CityCount) is being ranked and you gain a specific number of points for your place. Fame is still distributed by the total rank in the category but each single item is not able to decide a category ranking. Rankings are very close together.
Example: MoneyStock -> since this is ranked by itself the exact value does not matter as long as it is higher then the next empire.


## Categories
Fame is gained by being compared in different categories. Each categories sums together a number of different items (like number of territories, number of cities, etc.) which each has a different weight and affinity bonus.

- Military
- City
- State
- Economy


## Options

There are several game options in the pacing menu to customize your game experience.

#### Options for gaining Era Stars and their fame (vanilla, with modifier, scoring type)
#### Options for customizing the Scoring Rounds (fame amount, round number, fame multiplier, etc.)
#### Option for customizing the fame and era stars from the gameplay orientation stars


## Todo
- add additional items for ranking comparison and maybe a new category
- still needs balancing
- maybe beautify the tooltip further
