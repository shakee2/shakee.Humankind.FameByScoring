# Fame By Scoring Rounds

This project will change how you mainly gain fame in the Game Humankind from Amplitude Studios.

There two options for gaining fame:

#### by Ratio
You gain fame by being compared on category level. The ratio you have of the total sum of all empires is the ratio of fame you will gain. Since this compares your contribution in certain category to the sum of all empires, the fame you may gain can vary wildy between empires. The fame which is distributed per category is depending on the total number of empires in the game.

#### by Rank
You gain fame by being at a certain place in each category. Only the first 3 places gain additional fame. Generally, the fame the empires gain is more closely together.

## Categories
Fame is gained by being compared in different categories. Each categories sums together a number of different items which each has a different weight.

- Military
- Buildings
- State
- Economy
- Diplomacy (todo)

## Options
There are several game options in the pacing menu to customize your game. You can also deactivate the scoring rounds altogether.

## Todo
- add options for removing fame gain by Era Stars (and maybe adjustments to their amount)
- add UI Tooltips for last scoring round gain
- add additional items for ranking comparison
