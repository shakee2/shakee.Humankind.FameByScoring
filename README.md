# Fame By Scoring Rounds

This project will change how you mainly gain fame in the Game "Humankind" from Amplitude Studios.

There are three options for gaining fame:

#### by Ratio
You gain fame by being compared on category level. The ratio you have of the total sum of all empires is the ratio of fame you will gain. Since this compares your contribution in certain category to the sum of all empires, the fame you may gain can vary wildy between empires. The fame which is distributed per category is depending on the total number of empires in the game.
Example: MoneyStock -> this and all other items will be accumulated in the category, then it is checked how much percentage your value has against all others and this percentage determines your part of the total fame which is distributed. A single empire may reseve a large part of the total fame for itself if it has high values.

#### by Rank per Category
You gain fame by being at a certain place in each category. Only the first 3 places gain additional fame. Generally, the fame the empires gain is more closely together.
Example: MoneyStock -> like above, but instead of percentage ratio the ranking in the category is decided by the value each empire has. Someone with a very high value may decide the ranking with a single item. The fame each empire gains is limited to what the ranking place offers.

#### by Rank per Property
Every single item (like CityCount) is being ranked and you gain a specific number of points for your place. Fame is still distributed by the total rank in the category but each single item is not able to decide a category ranking. Ranking points are close together.
Example: MoneyStock -> since this is ranked by itself the exact value does not matter as long as it is higher then the next.


## Categories
Fame is gained by being compared in different categories. Each categories sums together a number of different items (like number of territories, number of cities, etc.) which each has a different weight.

- Military
- Buildings
- State
- Economy
- Diplomacy (todo)

## Options

There are several game options in the pacing menu to customize your game experience.


#### Options for gaining Era Stars and their fame (vanilla, with modifier, only by)
#### Options for customizing the Scoring Rounds (fame amount, round number, fame multiplier, etc.)


## Todo
- add UI Tooltips for last scoring round gain
- add additional items for ranking comparison
